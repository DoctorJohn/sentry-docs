---

**Issue Fix** is Seer's collaborative workflow that helps you find the root cause and solution of issues. Issue Fix uses Sentry's context (issue details, tracing data, and profiles), your codebase (integrated through GitHub), and its interactions with you to identify and reason through problems in your code. Issue Fix can identify the root cause and suggest a code change for fixing the issue and/or add unit tests for it.

Issue Fix replaces Suggested Fix (an earlier feature that has been sunset) and builds upon the capabilities previously known as Autofix.

## How Issue Fix Works

When you start an Issue Fix run, you'll see the following screen, with an option to share any additional context:

![Issue Fix Start Screen](./img/autofix-start-screen.png)

Issue Fix will then analyze the issue and relevant code to help identify the root cause and a solution. You'll see a live stream of Seer's thought process in real time as it works through the problem. Seer will share key insights as they come up and you'll have the option to expand each. You'll see the event data and code that support Seer's conclusions, building a clear chain of reasoning back to the root cause.

While Issue Fix is reasoning through your problem, you can step in at any time to add context or feedback; collaboration tends to lead to the best results. If Seer encounters gaps in its understanding, it will ask for your input.

The output will be a clearly defined root cause of the Sentry issue, and a detailed solution for how to resolve it:

You are free to edit or adjust this solution based on your own requirements and preferences. Once you are ready to proceed, you can select "Code It Up" to generate code resolving the bug. You have three options:

- Write a fix
- Write a unit test reproducing the issue
- Write both

Once the coding step is complete, you can either create a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub directly from Issue Fix, or create a branch and checkout the code locally if you would like to iterate further.

## Prerequisites

To use Issue Fix, you'll need:

1. **GitHub Integration**: Set up the [Sentry GitHub integration](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/) to connect your repositories
2. **Repository Access**: Ensure Seer has access to the repositories containing the code related to your issues
3. **Working Branch Configuration**: Configure the working branches where Seer should create fixes

## Setting Up Issue Fix

(Detailed setup instructions to be added by Product team, including:)

- Setting up Sentry GitHub integration
- Seer settings: picking repos, automatically inferring repos from code mappings/traces
- Setting working branches and custom instructions
- Enabling automation and frequency threshold settings
- Setting up the Seer-specific GitHub app for drafting PRs

## Collaborating with Seer

Issue Fix is designed to be collaborative. During the analysis process, you can:

- **Provide Context**: Add additional information about the issue or your codebase
- **Guide Analysis**: Help Seer understand specific aspects of your code or the problem
- **Review Solutions**: Examine and modify the proposed solutions before implementation
- **Give Feedback**: Help Seer improve its understanding through interaction

## Advanced Features

(To be expanded by Product team with details on:)

- Interacting with and correcting Seer's analysis
- Providing your own context and solution steps
- Tweaking generated code
- Managing automation settings
- Working with custom instructions

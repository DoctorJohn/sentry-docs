The Sentry SDK automatically attaches several default attributes to every log to provide essential context and enable better debugging capabilities.

### Core Attributes

The following attributes are attached to every log:

#### `sentry.environment`

The environment set in the SDK configuration (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `development`). This attribute is only included if an environment has been explicitly configured.

#### `sentry.release`

The release version set in the SDK configuration. This attribute is only included if a release has been explicitly configured.

#### `sentry.sdk.name`

The name of the SDK that sent the log (e.g., `sentry.javascript.node`, `sentry.python`).

#### `sentry.sdk.version`

The version of the SDK that sent the log (e.g., `9.11.0`).

#### `sentry.trace.parent_span_id`

The span ID of the span that was active when the log was collected. This attribute is only included if there was an active span at the time the log was created.

### Parameterized Message Attributes

When using parameterized logging (template strings with parameters), the SDK automatically extracts and stores the template and parameters separately:

#### `sentry.message.template`

The parameterized template string used for the log message.

#### `sentry.message.parameter.X`

The parameters passed to the template string. The `X` can be either:
- A number representing the parameter's position (`sentry.message.parameter.0`, `sentry.message.parameter.1`, etc.)
- The parameter's name for named parameters (`sentry.message.parameter.item_id`, `sentry.message.parameter.user_id`, etc.)

### SDK Integration Attributes

#### `sentry.origin`

When a log is generated by an SDK integration (rather than manually by user code), this attribute indicates the source of the log. For example, `auto.db.graphql` for database-related logs or `auto.http.fetch` for HTTP request logs.

### User Attributes (Optional)

If `sendDefaultPii` is enabled in the SDK configuration, the following user-related attributes may be attached when user context is available:

#### `user.id`

The user ID from the current user context.

#### `user.name`

The username from the current user context.

#### `user.email`

The email address from the current user context.

### Platform-Specific Attributes

Additional platform-specific attributes may be automatically attached depending on the SDK:

**Backend SDKs** (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.):
- `server.address`: The address/hostname of the server

**Mobile/Desktop/Native SDKs** (Android, iOS, Electron, etc.):
- `os.name`: Operating system name
- `os.version`: Operating system version  
- `device.brand`: Device brand (e.g., Apple, Samsung)
- `device.model`: Device model
- `device.family`: Device family

**Browser SDKs**:
- `browser.name`: Browser name (parsed from user agent)
- `browser.version`: Browser version (parsed from user agent)

### Example

Here's an example of how default attributes appear in a log:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1544719860.0,
  "level": "info",
  "body": "User John has completed checkout",
  "attributes": {
    "sentry.environment": {
      "value": "production",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sentry.release": {
      "value": "1.0.0", 
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sentry.sdk.name": {
      "value": "sentry.javascript.node",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sentry.sdk.version": {
      "value": "9.11.0",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sentry.trace.parent_span_id": {
      "value": "b0e6f15b45c36b12",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sentry.message.template": {
      "value": "User %s has completed checkout",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "sentry.message.parameter.0": {
      "value": "John",
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

These default attributes are automatically included and do not count against any attribute limits you may set in your logging configuration.

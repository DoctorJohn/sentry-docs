## üí° Quick Reference

### Most Common Tasks
```bash
# Start working on user docs
yarn dev

# Start working on developer docs  
yarn dev:developer-docs

# Add new SDK platform
# 1. Create docs/platforms/[platform]/
# 2. Add getting started content
# 3. Configure platform metadata

# Add shared content
# 1. Create in platform-includes/ or includes/
# 2. Reference with <PlatformContent> or <Include>
```

### File Locations
- **User docs**: `docs/[section]/[page].mdx`
- **Developer docs**: `develop-docs/[section]/[page].mdx`
- **Shared content**: `platform-includes/[name]/[platform].mdx`
- **Components**: `src/components/[name]/index.tsx`
- **Types**: `src/types/[name].ts`

### Essential Patterns
- Use MDX with frontmatter for all content
- Leverage shared content for consistency
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- TypeScript for all code
- Responsive, accessible design

# Example: Venmo API retired for new businesses - research prevented implementation issues

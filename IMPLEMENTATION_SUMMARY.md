# Implementation Summary: DSN Comments and Clipboard Improvements

This document summarizes the implementation of the GitHub issue [#13015](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/issues/13015) which requested improvements to the way users interact with DSN snippets in code examples.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Clipboard Functionality with Project Names

**Modified Files:**
- `src/components/codeBlock/index.tsx`
- `src/components/apiExamples/apiExamples.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `CodeContext` integration to access current project information
- Modified clipboard "Copied" message to show "Copied for [project name]" instead of just "Copied"
- Falls back to "Copied" if no project context is available

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Get the current project name for the copied message
const getCurrentProjectName = () => {
  if (!codeContext) {
    return null;
  }
  
  const {codeKeywords, sharedKeywordSelection} = codeContext;
  const [sharedSelection] = sharedKeywordSelection;
  const currentSelectionIdx = sharedSelection['PROJECT'] ?? 0;
  const currentProject = codeKeywords?.PROJECT?.[currentSelectionIdx];
  
  return currentProject?.title;
};

const projectName = getCurrentProjectName();
const copiedMessage = projectName ? `Copied for ${projectName}` : 'Copied';
```

### 2. Automatic DSN Comments in Code Examples

**New File Created:**
- `src/remark-dsn-comments.js`

**Modified Files:**
- `src/mdx.ts` (added plugin to processing pipeline)

**Functionality:**
- Automatically adds helpful comments above DSN patterns in code blocks
- Supports multiple programming languages with appropriate comment syntax:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: `// Hover over the DSN to see your project, or click it to select a different one`
  - Python/Ruby/Shell: `# Hover over the DSN to see your project, or click it to select a different one`
  - Java/C/C++/etc.: `// Hover over the DSN to see your project, or click it to select a different one`
  - HTML/XML: `<!-- Hover over the DSN to see your project, or click it to select a different one -->`
  - CSS: `/* Hover over the DSN to see your project, or click it to select a different one */`
  - YAML/TOML: `# Hover over the DSN to see your project, or click it to select a different one`

**Processing Logic:**
- Uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) processing via remark plugin
- Detects `___PROJECT.DSN___` patterns in code blocks
- Adds language-appropriate comments above DSN lines
- Prevents duplicate comments if they already exist
- Skips JSON files (which don't support comments)

## How It Works

### Project Context Integration
The existing `CodeContext` system already provides:
- Current selected project information via `sharedKeywordSelection`
- Project titles formatted as "org-name / project-name"
- Hover tooltips on DSN values showing project names

### Remark Plugin Processing
The new `remarkDsnComments` plugin is integrated into the MDX processing pipeline:
1. Processes all code blocks during build time
2. Searches for DSN patterns using regex: `/___PROJECT\.DSN___/g`
3. Determines appropriate comment syntax based on language
4. Inserts comments above DSN lines
5. Prevents duplicate comments

### Language Support
The plugin supports all major programming languages used in Sentry documentation:
- C-style languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, etc.)
- Python-style languages (Python, Ruby, Shell, YAML, etc.)
- Web languages (HTML, CSS, XML)
- Configuration formats (TOML, YAML)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users saw generic "Copied" message when copying code
- No guidance about DSN hover functionality
- Users had to discover project selection feature on their own

### After  
- Users see "Copied for [specific-project]" message, confirming which project the code is for
- Clear instructions appear above DSN in code examples
- Better discoverability of hover/click functionality for project selection

## Testing

The implementation has been added to the codebase but couldn't be fully tested due to missing production environment variables. However, the code changes are:

1. **Type-safe**: Using existing TypeScript interfaces and patterns
2. **Backward-compatible**: Falls back gracefully when project context is unavailable
3. **Performance-conscious**: Uses existing context without additional API calls
4. **Consistent**: Follows existing code patterns and styling

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/remark-dsn-comments.js` (new)
- `src/components/codeBlock/index.tsx`
- `src/components/apiExamples/apiExamples.tsx`
- `src/mdx.ts`

### No Breaking Changes
- All changes are additive and backward-compatible
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- New features enhance user experience without disrupting current workflows

## Future Considerations

1. **Testing**: Unit tests could be added for the remark plugin
2. **Customization**: Comment text could be made configurable if needed
3. **Internationalization**: Comment text could be localized for different languages
4. **Analytics**: Could track usage of the enhanced clipboard functionality

The implementation successfully addresses both requirements from the GitHub issue:
1. ✅ Added helpful comments above DSN in code examples
2. ✅ Enhanced clipboard messages to include specific project names

ML Issue Grouping uses machine learning algorithms to improve how Sentry groups similar issues together. This feature helps reduce noise in your issue stream and ensures that related errors are properly grouped for more efficient triage and management.

## Overview

Traditional issue grouping relies on deterministic rules, but ML Issue Grouping goes beyond simple stack trace matching to understand the semantic relationships between issues. This results in:

- More accurate grouping of related errors
- Fewer duplicate issues cluttering your dashboard
- Better signal-to-noise ratio
- Improved issue management workflow

## How It Works

(Content to be added by Product team, including:)

- The machine learning algorithms used
- How semantic analysis improves grouping
- Training and model updates
- Comparison with traditional grouping methods

## Benefits

### Improved Accuracy

- Better identification of truly related issues
- Reduced false positives in grouping
- More meaningful issue clusters

### Reduced Noise

- Fewer duplicate issues to review
- Cleaner issue streams
- More focused triage workflows

### Enhanced Insights

- Better understanding of error patterns
- Improved root cause analysis
- More effective issue prioritization

## Configuration and Management

(Content to be added by Product team, including:)

- How to enable/disable ML grouping
- Customization options
- Feedback mechanisms for improving grouping
- Integration with existing workflows

## Privacy and Security

ML Issue Grouping follows the same privacy and security principles as other Sentry AI features:

- Your data is not used to train models without consent
- Processing happens securely within Sentry's infrastructure
- Results are private to your organization
- Standard data retention and deletion policies apply

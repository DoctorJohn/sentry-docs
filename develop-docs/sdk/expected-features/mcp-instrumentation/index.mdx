title: MCP Instrumentation
---

The MCP Server module instruments Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDKs. At the moment it only supports the [MCP typescript sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/).

## Features

- [Tracing](./tracing)
- [Errors](./errors)

## Current limitations

Currently, it doesn't support automatic instrumentation due to [this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/16052) related to `import-in-the-middle`.

Instrumentation has to be done by wrapping the MCP server instance. This is done by the `wrapMcpServerWithSentry` function. For example:

```ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/core";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";

const mcpServer = new McpServer({
  name: 'My MCP Server',
});

const server = Sentry.wrapMcpServerWithSentry(mcpServer);
```

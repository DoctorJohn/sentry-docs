## Overview

With Structured Logs, users can send text based log information from their applications, whether frontend or backend, to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual parameters.

Not everything that you want to track in your application generates an error event. You might want to arbitrarily track information happening in your application for many reasons, such as: 

- Debugging information like navigation actions, page interactions, or query results
- User specific events
- Configuration items that users or an application are receiving 

## Supported SDKs

Structured logs are currently supported on the following SDKs: 

- JavaScript
- Python

## Enabling and Using Logs in Sentry

We've intentionally made the process for getting started with logs in Sentry low friction. Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the `Sentry.logger` APIs.

### Formatting Logs 

We've provided a format text function - `fmt` that you can use to add insert properties into to your log entries. These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs view as a dedicated column. 

### Example - Enable Logs in SDKs

```javascript 
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "YOUR SENTRY DSN",

  _experiments: {
    enableLogs: true,
  },
  
 // Rest of your Sentry configuration
 
});
```

### Example - Using Logs in Your application

```javascript 
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/javascript";

const { error, info, fmt } = Sentry.logger;

error(fmt`Uh on, something broke, here's the error: '${error}'`);
info(fmt`User '${user.username}' added item '${product.name}' to cart.`);
```

The Ruby SDK automatically sets several default attributes on all log entries to provide context and improve debugging:

### Core Attributes

- `sentry.environment`: The environment set in the SDK if defined
- `sentry.release`: The release set in the SDK if defined
- `sentry.trace.parent_span_id`: The span ID of the span that was active when the log was collected (only set if there was an active span)
- `sentry.sdk.name`: The name of the SDK that sent the log (`sentry.ruby`)
- `sentry.sdk.version`: The version of the SDK that sent the log

### Message Template Attributes

If the log was parameterized using format specifiers (like `%s`), the SDK will also set:

- `sentry.message.template`: The parameterized template string
- `sentry.message.parameter.X`: The parameters to the template string, where X is the parameter's position

### User Attributes

If user information is available in the current scope:

- `user.id`: The user ID
- `user.name`: The username
- `user.email`: The email address

### Server Attributes

For backend applications:

- `server.address`: The address of the server that sent the log (equivalent to server_name attached to errors and transactions)

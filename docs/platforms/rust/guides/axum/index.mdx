The Sentry SDK offers a middleware for the [`axum`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework that supports:

- Reporting errors and panics with the correct request correlation.
- Starting a [transaction](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/tracing/) for each request-response cycle.

The integration actually supports any crate based on [`tower`](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower), not just `axum`.

## Install

To add Sentry with the `axum` integration to your Rust project, just add a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml} 
[dependencies]
axum = "0.8.4"
tower = "0.5.2"
tokio = { version = "1.45.0", features = ["full"] }
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["tower-axum-matched-path"] }
```

## Configure

Initialize and configure the Sentry client. This will enable a set of default integrations, such as panic reporting.
Then, initialize `axum` with the Sentry middleware.

<Alert level="warning">

Macros like `#[tokio::main]` are not supported. The Sentry client must be initialized before the async runtime is started, as shown below.

</Alert>

```rust {filename:main.rs}
use axum::{body::Body, http::Request, routing::get, Router};
use sentry::integrations::tower::{NewSentryLayer, SentryHttpLayer};
use std::io;
use tower::ServiceBuilder;

async fn failing() -> () {
    panic!("Everything is on fire!")
}

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            // Capture all traces and spans. Set to a lower value in production.
            traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
            // Capture user IPs and potentially sensitive headers when using HTTP server integrations
            // see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/rust/data-management/data-collected for more info
            send_default_pii: true,
            ..Default::default()
        },
    ));

    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(failing)).layer(
        ServiceBuilder::new()
            // If you're binding the layers directly on the `Router`, bind them in the opposite order, otherwise you might run into a memory leak.
            .layer(NewSentryLayer::<Request<Body>>::new_from_top()) // Bind a new Hub per request, to ensure correct error <> request correlation
            .layer(SentryHttpLayer::new().enable_transaction()), // Start a transaction (Sentry root span) for each request
    );

    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
        .enable_all()
        .build()?
        .block_on(async {
            let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3001")
                .await
                .unwrap();
            axum::serve(listener, app.into_make_service())
                .await
                .unwrap();
        });

    Ok(())
}
```

## Verify

The snippet above sets up a service that always panics, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Send a request to the application. The panic will be captured by Sentry.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/
```

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

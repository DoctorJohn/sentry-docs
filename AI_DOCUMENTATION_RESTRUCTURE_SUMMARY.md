- üìù ML Issue Grouping content
- üìù Additional Issue Fix setup instructions
- üìù TTL and data lifecycle details

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: AI features are grouped logically
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new AI features
3. **Clear Separation**: Seer vs. other AI features distinction
4. **Future-Proof**: Structure supports growth of AI capabilities
5. **User-Friendly**: Logical navigation and discovery

## Notes for Content Team

- **Issue Scan**: Needs comprehensive content about filtering, actionability scores, and Seer labels
- **ML Issue Grouping**: Completely new content needed
- **Issue Fix Setup**: Detailed GitHub integration and configuration instructions needed
- **Privacy Details**: TTL and data lifecycle management content needed
- **Email Address**: Updated feedback email to `ai-feedback@sentry.io`

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify all internal links work correctly
2. Test redirect from old Seer page
3. Check that images display properly in Issue Fix documentation
4. Validate navigation structure in documentation site
5. Confirm search functionality includes new content

## Rollout Considerations

- The old Seer page remains accessible with deprecation notice
- Redirects ensure existing bookmarks continue to work
- All existing external links will redirect to the main AI section
- Content is backward-compatible during transition period

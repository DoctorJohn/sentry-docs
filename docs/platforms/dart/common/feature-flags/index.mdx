description: With Feature Flags, Sentry tracks feature flag evaluations in your application, keeps an audit log feature flag changes, and reports any suspicious updates that may have caused an error.

<PlatformContent includePath="feature-flags/prerelease-alert" />

## Prerequisites

- [Sentry SDK](/platforms/dart/#configure) version `9.0.0` or higher is installed.

## Enable Evaluation Tracking

If you use a third-party SDK to evaluate feature flags, you can enable a Sentry SDK integration to track those evaluations. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported SDKs is listed below.

- [Firebase Remote Config](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/firebase-remote-config/)

### Manual Usage

Call `Sentry.addFeatureFlag` to track feature flag evaluations.

```dart
Sentry.addFeatureFlag("feature_flag_a", true);
```

Calling this function multiple times with the same flag name will override the previous value.

Seer is designed with privacy and security as core principles. We understand that your code and application data are sensitive, and we've built comprehensive safeguards to protect your information while providing powerful AI capabilities.

## Data Processing for Seer

We use the data listed below to provide insights, analysis, and solutions for your review. Your data will not be used to train any generative AI models without your express consent and AI-generated output from your data is shown only to you, not other customers. Our generative AI features are powered by generative AI models hosted by subprocessors identified on our [subprocessor list](https://sentry.io/legal/subprocessors/). Our subprocessors are only permitted to use the data as directed by us.

The data used for Seer features includes:
- Error messages
- Stack traces
- Sentry spans
- DOM interactions
- Profiles
- Relevant code from linked repositories

You can learn more about our data privacy practices in our [Service Data Usage policy](/security-legal-pii/security/service-data-usage/#use-of-identifying-data-for-generative-ai-features).

## Privacy Guarantees

### No Training on Your Data

Your data will **never** be used to train any generative AI models without your explicit written consent. This means:

- Your code remains private to your organization
- Your error data isn't shared with other customers
- AI model training doesn't include your proprietary information
- Your business logic and implementation details stay confidential

### Output Privacy

AI-generated output from your data is shown only to you and your team members with appropriate access. Other Sentry customers never see:

- Your specific error patterns
- AI analysis of your code
- Generated fixes or solutions
- Any insights derived from your data

### Regional Data Storage

To ensure that data is stored in your selected region, we will disable generative AI features in Sentry for EU region customers by default where data storage in the EU region is not available.

## Security Measures

### Data Handling Protocols

1. **Data Scrubbing**: We encourage all customers to use our [various data scrubbing tools](/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/) so that service data is sanitized before we receive it
2. **Automatic PII Removal**: We scrub data for personally identifiable information (PII) before it goes into any AI processing
3. **Retention Alignment**: We apply the same deletion and retention rules to AI processing data as we do to the underlying service data
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: If you delete service data, it will also be removed from our AI processing automatically

### Subprocessor Security

We only use generative AI models that are:
- Built in-house and deployed in our production cloud
- Provided by our existing trusted [third-party subprocessors](https://sentry.io/legal/subprocessors/)
- Bound by contractual commitments consistent with our privacy and security standards

## Data Access Controls

| **Feature** | **Data Used** | **Training Usage** | **Shared with Others** | **Regional Storage** |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Seer Issue Scan** | Error patterns, metadata | No | No | Yes (where available) |
| **Seer Issue Fix** | Code, traces, errors | No | No | Yes (where available) |
| **AI Analysis** | All Seer data types | No | No | Yes (where available) |

## Turning Off AI Features

If you don't find Seer useful and want to disable it for all users, you can do so in your organization's settings with the ["Show Generative AI Features" toggle](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/#hideAiFeatures).

When disabled:
- All AI processing of your data stops immediately
- Existing AI-generated content remains accessible for historical reference
- No new AI analysis or processing occurs
- Your data continues to be handled according to standard Sentry privacy policies

Seer's data handling practices are covered under Sentry's existing compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2 Type II**: Regular security audits and controls
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection for EU users
- **Data Processing Agreements**: Available for enterprise customers
- **Security Documentation**: Detailed security practices available upon request

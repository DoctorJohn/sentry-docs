The Sentry SDK offers an integration for tokio's [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) ecosystem that supports:

- Reporting `tracing` events to Sentry events, breadcrumbs, or logs.
- Reporting `tracing` spans to Sentry.
- Reporting errors and panics with the correct trace correlation.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance"]}
/>

To add Sentry with the `tracing` integration to your Rust project, add the necessary dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
tracing = "0.1.41"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3.19"
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["tracing"] }
```

## Configure

Initialize the Sentry SDK and register the Sentry layer to start sending `tracing` events and spans to Sentry:

```rust
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Initialize Sentry
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
            // Capture all traces and spans. Set to a lower value in production
            traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
            ..sentry::ClientOptions::default()
        },
    });

    // Register the Sentry tracing layer
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
        .with(sentry::integrations::tracing::layer())
        .init();

    fail();
}

# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
#[tracing::instrument] // Capture a span for this function call
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
fn fail() {
    tracing::error!("Everything is on fire!");
}
```

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Select Issues, and then Errors & Outages in the sidebar, where you will find the newly created issue. Clicking on the issue's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

### [Other AI Features](/product/ai-in-sentry/other-ai-features/)

Beyond Seer, Sentry includes additional AI and ML features to enhance your development workflow:

- **[Issue Summary](/product/ai-in-sentry/other-ai-features/issue-summary/)**: AI-generated summaries of issues to quickly understand what's happening

## Getting Started

To get started with Sentry's AI features, you'll need:

1. A paid Sentry account (AI features are currently free for paid customers during beta)
2. Proper integrations set up (like GitHub for Seer's Issue Fix)

## Data Privacy and Security

Sentry takes data privacy seriously when it comes to AI features. Your data is never used to train AI models without your express consent, and AI-generated output is only shown to you, not to other customers.

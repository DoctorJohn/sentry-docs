Beyond Seer, Sentry includes several other AI and machine learning features designed to enhance your development workflow and provide better insights into your application's behavior.

## AI-Powered Features

### [Issue Summary](/product/ai-in-sentry/other-ai-features/issue-summary/)

Issue Summary uses AI to provide quick overviews of issues by highlighting key insights from event and issue-level metadata. Instead of manually analyzing stack traces and error details, you get an AI-generated summary that helps you quickly understand:

- What's going wrong in your application
- Potential causes of the issue
- Relevant insights from trace-connected issues
- Context to help prioritize and triage

### [ML Issue Grouping](/product/ai-in-sentry/other-ai-features/ml-issue-grouping/)

Machine Learning Issue Grouping improves how Sentry groups similar issues together. By using advanced ML algorithms, this feature provides:

- More accurate grouping of related errors
- Better signal-to-noise ratio in your issue stream
- Reduced duplicate issues
- Improved issue management and triage

## How These Features Work

These AI features operate differently from Seer:

- **Automatic Processing**: They work automatically on your incoming data
- **No Setup Required**: Most features are enabled by default and require no configuration
- **Privacy-First**: Like all Sentry AI features, they respect your data privacy and security requirements
- **Complementary**: They work alongside Seer to provide a comprehensive AI-enhanced experience

## Availability

These AI features are available to Sentry customers as part of our ongoing effort to improve the platform with AI and machine learning capabilities. Some features may be:

- Generally available to all customers
- In beta for specific customer tiers
- Gradually rolling out across organizations

Check your organization settings or contact support for specific availability information.

## Privacy and Data Usage

Like all AI features in Sentry, these capabilities:

- Process your data securely and privately
- Don't use your data to train models without consent
- Show AI-generated output only to your organization
- Follow the same data retention and deletion policies as your other Sentry data

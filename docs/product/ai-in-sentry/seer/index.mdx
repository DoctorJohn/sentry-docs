Seer is Sentry's AI agent that powers intelligent issue analysis and automated code fixes. By combining Sentry's rich context (issue details, tracing data, and profiles) with your codebase and AI-powered analysis, Seer helps you understand and resolve issues faster than ever before.

## Seer Capabilities

Seer provides two main capabilities to enhance your debugging workflow:

### [Issue Scan](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/issue-scan/)

Issue Scan intelligently analyzes your issues and provides actionability scores to help you prioritize what to work on. With Issue Scan, you can:

- Filter issues by their last scan results
- View actionability scores that indicate how likely an issue can be resolved
- See Seer labels in the issue stream for quick identification
- Get insights into which issues deserve immediate attention

### [Issue Fix](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/issue-fix/)

Issue Fix is a collaborative workflow that uses AI to find the root cause and suggest solutions for your issues. With Issue Fix, you can:

- Get automated root cause analysis using Sentry's context and your codebase
- Receive AI-generated code fixes and unit tests
- Collaborate with Seer throughout the debugging process
- Create pull requests directly from the Seer interface
- Benefit from GitHub integration for seamless code changes

## How Seer Works

Seer leverages multiple data sources to provide accurate analysis and solutions:

- **Issue Context**: Error messages, stack traces, and event metadata
- **Tracing Data**: Distributed traces and span information
- **Code Repository**: Your source code through GitHub integration
- **Performance Data**: Profiles and performance metrics
- **Interactive Feedback**: Your input and guidance during the process

## Getting Started with Seer

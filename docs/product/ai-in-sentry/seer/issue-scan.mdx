Issue Scan is Seer's intelligent issue analysis feature that helps you prioritize which issues to work on by providing actionability scores and insights.

## Features

- **Actionability Scoring**: Get AI-powered scores that indicate how likely an issue can be resolved
- **Filtering Options**: Filter issues by their last scan run and actionability scores
- **Seer Labels**: Visual indicators in the issue stream for quick identification
- **Priority Insights**: Understand which issues deserve immediate attention

## How It Works

Issue Scan analyzes your issues using Sentry's context, error patterns, and machine learning to determine:

- How actionable an issue is
- The likelihood of successful resolution
- Priority recommendations based on impact and solvability

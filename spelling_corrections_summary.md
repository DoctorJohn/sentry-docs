## Methodology

1. Used `cspell` to identify potential spelling errors across all 3,991 .mdx files
2. Analyzed the 7,258 flagged words to identify genuine errors vs. technical terms
3. Focused on compound words that were missing spaces and clear misspellings
4. Fixed all identified errors while preserving the technical accuracy of the documentation

All corrections maintain the original meaning and technical accuracy while improving readability and proper spelling.

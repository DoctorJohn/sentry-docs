Issue Summary provides a quick overview of an issue by highlighting key insights taken from event and issue-level metadata. Instead of manually analyzing stack traces, error messages, and related data, you get an AI-generated summary that helps you quickly understand what's going wrong, potential causes, and relevant insights from trace-connected issues.

## How Issue Summary Works

Issue Summary analyzes various aspects of your issues to generate concise, actionable summaries:

### Data Sources

Issue Summary examines:
- **Error Messages**: The actual error text and context
- **Stack Traces**: Call stack information and function details
- **Event Metadata**: Tags, user information, and environment details
- **Performance Data**: Related traces and spans when available
- **Historical Context**: Patterns from similar issues

### Generated Insights

From this analysis, Issue Summary provides:
- **What's Happening**: A clear description of the problem
- **Potential Causes**: Likely reasons for the issue occurrence
- **Impact Assessment**: Understanding of how the issue affects users
- **Related Information**: Connections to traces and other relevant data

## Where to Find Issue Summaries

Issue summaries appear in several places throughout the Sentry interface:

- **Issue Details Page**: At the top of individual issue pages
- **Issue Lists**: In hover previews and expanded views
- **Triage Workflows**: As part of issue review processes
- **Notifications**: In alert emails and integration messages (where applicable)

## Benefits of Issue Summary

### Faster Triage

- Quickly understand the nature of an issue without deep diving into technical details
- Prioritize issues based on AI insights about their impact and causes
- Reduce time spent on initial issue assessment

### Better Context

- Get insights that might not be immediately obvious from raw error data
- Understand connections between different parts of your application
- See patterns that help with root cause analysis

### Team Collaboration

- Share easily digestible issue information with team members
- Help non-technical stakeholders understand the impact of issues
- Improve communication about bugs and their priority

## Example Summary

Here's what an Issue Summary might look like:

> **What's happening:** Users are experiencing a database connection timeout when attempting to save their profile information.
>
> **Potential cause:** The database connection pool appears to be exhausted during peak traffic periods, particularly affecting the user profile update endpoint.
>
> **Related insights:** This issue correlates with slow response times in the `/api/users/profile` endpoint and has been occurring more frequently since the recent traffic increase.

## Availability and Privacy

Issue Summary is:
- **Automatically generated** for most issues
- **Available to all paid Sentry customers** (currently in beta)

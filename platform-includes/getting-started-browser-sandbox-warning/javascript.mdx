<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

Errors triggered from within your browser's developer tools (like the browser console) are sandboxed, so they will not trigger Sentry's error monitoring. You can capture application console calls and search, filter, and analyze them alongside your error events with [Logs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/).
